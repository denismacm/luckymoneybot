# Lucky Money Bot
Lucky Money Bot

In light of Lunar New Year and COVID-19, I wanted to build something that would help people of my culture strengthen their bond together.

Bau Cua Ca Cop (gourd-crab-fish-tiger) is a game from my fond childhood memories where I would shout the names of animals that I believed would land upon rolling three die. If you guessed correctly, your bet would become your profit. If your guess appears twice or three times, then your profit would be double or triple, respectively.

Because of my ambition and desire to forge this game that appeared to be nowhere online, I built this bot using Python programming, Discord API and JSON. I also used REPL.IT to host my bot.

Currently, you can use this link to add the bot to your own server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=805731599005122580&permissions=264256&scope=bot (Be sure to use the command !lm help)

I have also created a server for the bot itself at https://discord.gg/ETVvj7ya6t.
